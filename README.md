## description

***

This is an assignment to update our portfolio that was created earlier.<br>
The work was envisioned through wireframe diagrams first and the container tags were assigned accordingly. The codebase was semantically organized and accessibility concepts were addressed. It is employing several new tools like flexbox, media queries, pseudo elements, CSS variables and absolute positioning. This work was completed by using HTML and
CSS coding. Best viewed at full screen, 16:10 aspect ratio.<br>
<br>

## acceptance criteria

***

The codebase achieves the following criteria:<br>

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:
* WHEN I load their portfolio; THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to<br>
sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation; THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work; THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of<br>
the developer's applications.
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application; THEN that application's image should be larger<br>
in size than the others.
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications; THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices; THEN I am presented with a responsive<br>
layout that adapts to my viewport.
